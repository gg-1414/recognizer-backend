# Recognizer (Back-end)

We wanted to create an app that will play a random song based on the user's current emotion: happiness, disgust, anger, neutral, sadness, surprise, or fear. And a visualizer (collecting the audio frequency in real time) in the background as an added bonus.

Please refer to the front-end README:
